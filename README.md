# 🪶 Mumei's Sketchbook: A Living Archive of the Guardian

> *"Wherever I go, no matter what I face, I will remember you! (Me too, Mumei)"*

## 🦉 A Personal Dedication
This website wasn't built for a grade, and it wasn't built for profit. It was built out of a deep, personal love for **Nanashi Mumei**. 

There was a time in my life when my heart was at its lowest. Everything felt dim, and the world felt heavy. During those days, Mumei was the light. Her voice, her chaotic energy, her kindness, and her incredible art became the bridge that carried me back to a better place. I miss her more than I can put into words, and building this is my way of making sure the light she brought into my life never fully fades away.

## 🎨 Why This Archive Matters (To me)
She is the reason I learned not to give up on my dreams and my future. It has been a rough time, but Mumei's streams helped me fight through each day. My only regret is that I didn't watch her as often as I could have when she was around, and that realization broke me when the announcement came. 

But for your greater good, Mumei, I support your decision. This is my way to remember you. I don't want to forget at all, so I will keep this in my workplace and revisit these memories every day. Thanks for reading!

## 🎓 A Note from the Creator
I am just a college student. I’m still learning how to code, how to design, and how to build things that last. 

Because I am still learning, this website isn't perfect. It's a work in progress, just like civilization itself. I am doing my best to honor her presence through this code This archive is small right now, but I want it to grow until it holds every memory we have of her art.

## 🦉 Closing Thoughts
To Mumei: You were the brightest spark when I was in the dark. I promised to remember, and this is my promise in code. 

**"Wherever I go, no matter what I face, I will remember you!"**
And this is my way to keep remembering you too! <3
