## 🦉 A Personal Dedication
This website wasn't built for a grade, and it wasn't built for profit. It was built out of a deep, personal love for **Nanashi Mumei**. 

There was a time in my life when my heart was at its lowest. Everything felt dim, and the world felt heavy. During those days, Mumei was the light. Her voice, her chaotic energy, her kindness, and her incredible art became the bridge that carried me back to a better place. I miss her more than I can put into words, and building this is my way of making sure the light she brought into my life never fully fades away.

## 🎨 Why This Archive Matters (To me)
She is the reason I learned not to give up on my dreams and my future. It has been a rough time, but Mumei's streams helped me fight through each day. My only regret is that I didn't watch her as often as I could have when she was around, and that realization broke me when the announcement came. 

But for your greater good, Mumei, I support your decision. This is my way to remember you. I don't want to forget at all, so I will keep this in my workplace and revisit these memories every day. Thanks for reading!
